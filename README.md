Zambia has the highest prevalance rates for cervical cancer in the world. The country has a newly developed cancer hospital, but the majority of cases come from rural areas, and by the time they come to the hospital for treatment, they are quite advanced, rendering treatment of little effect. There are no cancer experts in the rural parts which are ill equiped. Cancers are best treated when detected early. The Hope4All project aims at finding ways to create/provide technologies that can make early diagnosis of cancers throughout the country, most especially the rural areas, posible. Many lives, have been lost to cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and cervical cancer among others. It is up to us to make a real difference.
